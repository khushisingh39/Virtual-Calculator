# Virtual-Calculator
## A hand gesture-controlled calculator built with OpenCV and Python.

**About:**

A Virtual Calculator is a computer application that simulates a traditional calculator but allows users to interact with it using hand gestures instead of physical buttons. This project utilizes computer vision techniques to recognize hand movements and map them to corresponding calculator functions.


**Features:**

**1. Real-time hand tracking:** Utilizes OpenCV to detect and track hand movements.

**2. Calculator interface:** Displays a virtual calculator with standard buttons.

**3. Gesture-based input:** Maps hand gestures to calculator button presses.

**4. Basic arithmetic operations:** Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

**5. Clear and delete functions:** Allows users to clear the entire equation or delete the last character.

**6. Error handling:** Detects and displays error messages for invalid expressions.
